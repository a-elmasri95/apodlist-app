Using the flutter SDK, this simple app retrieves images and metadata from the NASA APOD API https://api.nasa.gov/ using REST API, and displays them in a listView.
Can also search by start/end dates using a datepicker to render all the astronomy pictures that have been posted within a date range, and then refresh.
